# Cross-platform (Windows + Linux) support — design

**Status:** Landed on `main` — Phase 0 (platform abstraction, verified on macOS),
build/CI matrix, Windows/Linux text insertion (enigo), and frontend OS-awareness.
Windows autostart is **deliberately deferred** (see Phase 2). Remaining Windows
work (hotkey + insertion behavior, autostart) needs a real machine/VM to verify.
**Date:** 2026-07-01
**Scope:** Make SayType — today a macOS-only Tauri 2 + Rust app — run on Windows
and Linux, starting with a behavior-preserving abstraction layer, then filling
platforms one at a time (Windows first, Linux next, native Wayland out of scope
for v1).

## Decisions (locked)

1. **Abstraction layer first.** Collect every `#[cfg(target_os)]` capability
   behind `src-tauri/src/platform/` with a clear contract; macOS behavior stays
   identical; non-macOS keeps its current stub behavior. Then fill platforms.
2. **Pragmatic implementation style.** Prefer mature cross-platform crates when
   filling platforms — `enigo` for synthetic input — over hand-rolled per-OS FFI.
   (Autostart is the exception: see Phase 2 — deferred, and macOS is NOT migrated
   to a plugin.)
3. **Windows before Linux.** Windows is low-risk and ships fast. Linux X11 is
   medium. **Native Wayland is explicitly out of scope for v1** (run under
   XWayland); it breaks both the global hold-hotkey and synthetic insertion at
   once, with no clean cross-compositor solution.
4. **Mac-only development is viable.** Code, compile-checking (`cargo-xwin` for
   Windows, Docker for Linux), and producing installers (CI matrix) all happen
   on the Mac / in CI. Only final behavioral QA needs the target OS (VM / cloud
   / borrowed machine), and it can be deferred.

## What's already portable (verified, zero work)

Transcription, HTTP (`reqwest` + `rustls-tls`, no system OpenSSL at runtime),
settings, history, dictionary, `dirs` paths + atomic writes, the tray, the
windows, the single-instance plugin, and the platform-agnostic hotkey state
machine all compile and run cross-platform unchanged. macOS-only crates
(`core-foundation`, `objc`) are already `cfg`-gated.

## Phase 0 — platform abstraction (DONE)

New module `src-tauri/src/platform/`:

- `mod.rs` — the contract + compile-time selection (`macos` vs `fallback`) +
  the shared `InsertResult` enum.
- `macos.rs` — the existing macOS implementation, moved verbatim: Accessibility
  / Microphone checks, CGEvent Unicode insertion with the focused-field guard,
  `pbcopy` clipboard write, opening the Accessibility pane, the LaunchAgent
  login item.
- `fallback.rs` — current non-macOS behavior (permissions "not required" /
  "granted", insertion `Unsupported`, clipboard error, autostart no-op). Splits
  into `windows.rs` / `linux.rs` when those platforms are filled.

### Contract

```rust
fn accessibility_required() -> bool;          // macOS: true;  others: false
fn accessibility_granted(prompt: bool) -> bool; // macOS: AX;  others: true
fn microphone_status() -> String;             // macOS: AVFoundation; others: "granted"
fn open_accessibility_settings();             // macOS: open pane; others: no-op
fn copy_to_clipboard(text: &str) -> Result<()>; // macOS: pbcopy; others: Err
fn insert_text(text: &str) -> InsertResult;   // macOS: focus+CGEvent; others: Unsupported
fn set_auto_launch(enabled: bool) -> Result<()>; // macOS: plist; others: no-op
```

`InsertResult` = `Inserted { method }` | `NoEditableTarget` | `Failed` |
`Unsupported`; `commands::type_text` maps each to the user-facing response, so
all copy stays in the command layer.

### Call sites rewired

`commands.rs` (`type_text`, `show_permission_dialog`, `copy_to_clipboard`,
`check_microphone_permission`, `accessibility_status`,
`current_accessibility_granted`), `settings.rs` (`update_auto_launch` delegates
to `platform::set_auto_launch`), `hotkey.rs` (the macOS listener's permission
gate now calls `platform::accessibility_granted(false)`; the duplicate
`AXIsProcessTrusted` FFI is gone). The hotkey **event source** (CGEventTap /
`rdev`) intentionally stays in `hotkey.rs` — it is cohesive and already
`cfg`-split; only its permission gate moved.

### Also in Phase 0

- `SettingsPayload` gained an **`os`** field (`std::env::consts::OS`) so the
  frontend can pick OS-correct copy / modifier glyphs instead of the deprecated
  `navigator.platform`. (Frontend not yet consuming it.)

### Verification

`cargo test` → 18 passed. `cargo check` (macОС) clean. Behavior on macOS is
unchanged. The non-macOS arm is verified by the CI matrix (below); bare
`cargo check --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` on a Mac fails inside `ring`'s C
build (no MSVC headers) — use `cargo-xwin` for local Windows compile-checks.

## Phase 1 — build plumbing (DONE in this pass)

- `bundle.targets` → `"all"` (host-aware: dmg on macOS, nsis/msi on Windows,
  deb/rpm/appimage on Linux).
- New `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: matrix [macos-latest, windows-latest,
  ubuntu-22.04] that builds and uploads installers as artifacts. Additive — the
  signed/notarized macOS `release.yml` is untouched. This is the build farm +
  the authoritative non-macOS compile check.
- Linux build deps documented in the workflow (webkit2gtk-4.1, libxdo,
  libxtst, libayatana-appindicator, librsvg, patchelf, …).

## Phase 2 — Windows (largely landed; autostart deferred)

Low-risk. WebView2 = Chromium gives getUserMedia / MediaRecorder / WASM-VAD for
free (one-time mic prompt).

**Done (on `main`):**
- **Text insertion** — `enigo` 0.3.0 (`cfg(not(target_os = "macos"))`, MSRV 1.75)
  in `fallback.rs`: `Enigo::new(&Settings::default())` + `.text()` (SendInput
  KEYEVENTF_UNICODE on Windows, XTEST/libxdo on Linux/X11). Shared by Windows +
  Linux; the `InsertResult::Unsupported` variant was dropped. macOS keeps CGEvent.
- **Frontend insertion check** — `input-prompt.js` now keys success off
  `result.success` (the method string differs per OS: `cgevent_unicode` vs
  `enigo_text`).
- **Frontend OS-awareness** — `main.js` / `input-prompt.js` render modifier
  labels from the backend `os` field: Apple glyphs on macOS, words
  (Ctrl/Shift/Alt/Win|Super) on Windows/Linux; i18n hint neutralized to
  "Shift + Alt".
- **CI** — Linux deps include libxdo / libxkbcommon / libx11 / libxtst; all three
  legs build and upload installers.

**Compiles, but needs real-machine verification:**
- **Global hotkey** — the existing `rdev::listen` branch (WH_KEYBOARD_LL) is live
  on Windows; the hotkey state machine is unchanged. UIPI caveat: a non-elevated
  app can't inject into / hook elevated foreground windows.

**Deferred — do NOT build blind:**
- **Autostart** stays the `fallback.rs` no-op. Rationale: it is non-core (the app
  works fully without it), cannot be behaviorally verified without a Windows
  machine, and there are no Windows/Linux users yet. A compile-green autostart
  says nothing about whether it actually launches at login, so shipping it now
  would be false "done". Build it when there's a machine/VM to test on (Windows:
  HKCU `Run` key; Linux: `~/.config/autostart/*.desktop`), likely via the
  `auto-launch` crate gated to non-macOS.
- **macOS autostart stays on the hand-rolled LaunchAgent plist and is NOT
  migrated to `tauri-plugin-autostart`.** Migrating would swap a working
  mechanism on the primary (daily-driver) platform for a different one
  (AppleScript login item / plugin plist) plus an old-plist cleanup migration —
  unjustified regression risk. Revisit only with a concrete reason.

macOS Phase 0 refactor was verified end-to-end by the developer
(`build:mac:install` + hands-on dictation) — no regression.

## Phase 3 — Linux X11

- `windows.rs`/`linux.rs`: `enigo` (xdo/XTEST) insertion, `rdev` (XRecord)
  hotkey, `.desktop` autostart.
- **Critical prerequisite spike:** verify/enable WebKitGTK getUserMedia
  (`-DENABLE_MEDIA_STREAM`/`-DENABLE_WEB_RTC` + gst-plugins-bad + a wry
  permission handler + `GDK_BACKEND=x11`). If stock distro WebKitGTK lacks
  media-stream, the app **cannot record at all** — this may force bundling a
  WebKitGTK (AppImage) and is the single biggest Linux blocker.
- Validate tray visibility (GNOME ships no tray by default — the app is
  tray-driven, so this needs a mitigation) and transparent-window rendering.

## Phase 4 — Linux Wayland (out of scope for v1)

Run under XWayland. If pursued later: `enigo` libei insertion (GNOME ≥ 46 /
KDE ≥ 6.1, non-ASCII reliability unverified — a real risk for Chinese
dictation), evdev/portal hotkey, and an honest "wayland-limited" status.

## Phase 5 — distribution hardening (deferred)

Windows Authenticode (Azure Trusted Signing / EV), Linux checksums/GPG,
WebView2 install-mode choice, auto-update strategy.

## Known cross-cutting risks

WebKitGTK getUserMedia (Linux blocker), Wayland (both core features), enigo
libei non-ASCII reliability, `rdev 0.5` is old/unmaintained yet carries the
Win + Linux-X11 hotkey, GNOME invisible tray, no cross-compile from Mac
(CI-dependent), transparent always-on-top input-prompt rendering on Linux.
