//! "The app was activated" hook for macOS.
//!
//! Why objc is unavoidable: Cmd+Tab (and the app switcher, and Mission Control)
//! only *activates* the app. macOS sends the Launch Services reopen event that
//! `RunEvent::Reopen` rides on for Dock clicks / Spotlight / `open -a`, but a
//! plain activation sends nothing — so with every window hidden, SayType comes
//! to the front owning the menu bar and showing no window at all, which reads
//! as a broken app. AppKit's `NSApplicationDidBecomeActiveNotification` is the
//! only signal that covers activation, and Tauri does not surface it.
